##Hi, seems like there's some smart people there after all

Feel free to contribute and maybe put your friends head on the site
All you need to do is to download one of the images in the /img/ folder, use an app (like photoshop) and change the head.
(maybe if you are too smart try to change the code (the javascript in /js ) so that we could use more than 6 pictures. 

Let this be a friendly joke, so don't make people mad.
